# PoPreRo: A New Dataset for Popularity Prediction of Romanian Reddit Posts (ICPR 2024)

We introduce PoPreRo, the first dataset for Popularity Prediction of Romanian posts collected from Reddit. The PoPreRo dataset includes a varied compilation of post samples from five distinct subreddits of Romania, totaling 28,107 data samples. 

Along with our novel dataset, we introduce a set of competitive models to be used as baselines for future research. Interestingly, the top-scoring model achieves an accuracy of 61.35% and a macro F1 score of 60.60% on the test set, indicating that the popularity prediction task on PoPreRo is very challenging. Further investigations with based on few-shot prompting the Falcon-7B Large Language Model also point in the same direction. We thus believe that PoPreRo is a valuable resource that can be used to evaluate models on predicting the popularity of social media posts in Romanian.

The PoPreRo dataset introduced in the paper "PoPreRo: A New Dataset for Popularity Prediction of Romanian Reddit Posts (ICPR 2024)" is available, together with the four baselines.

### Project structure

\ Dataset -  folder where the subreddit data is available. 


The proposed split of the five subreddits data was done as followed:

|            | Unpopular |     Unpopular      |  Popular       | Popular |    Total    |Total   | 
|------------|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|--------|---------|
| Set        | #posts    | #tokens   | #posts  | #tokens | #posts | #tokens |
| Train (Romanian subreddit)     | 12,053    | 398,219   | 11,592  | 560,580 | 23,645 | 958,799 |
| Validation (Bucuresti subreddit)| 1,059     | 75,742    | 1,054   | 80,297  | 2,113  | 156,039 |
| Test (Iasi, Timisoara, Cluj subreddit)      | 1,177     | 72,819    | 1,172   | 93,268  | 2,349  | 168,867 |

\ Mehods - folder which contains the four baselines as ipynb notebooks.



## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

There are no environment dependencies that should be installed, although the dataset should be downloaded before running each of the the notebooks.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The training and testing of the models is performed by running the notebook with the respective model name.
